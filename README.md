# Machine Learning for Everybody - First ML Project

This project is my first-ever Machine Learning code, inspired by the freeCodeCamp YouTube tutorial [Machine Learning for Everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&t=1820s). The project demonstrates the implementation of basic machine learning concepts using Python and several popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the basic concepts of machine learning by implementing a simple ML model. The tutorial covers the following key topics:

- Loading and preparing the dataset
- Preprocessing the data (scaling and handling class imbalance)
- Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., KNN)
- Evaluating the performance of the model

This project serves as an introduction to machine learning and provides a solid foundation for understanding more advanced concepts.
